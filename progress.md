# Four-Point Configuration Validation Feature

## 1. Overview of the Feature

This feature implements a validation mechanism for checking if four selected points in a glyph contour meet a specific geometric configuration. When triggered, it evaluates whether the selected points form a valid configuration as defined by the following criteria:

1. The four points must be consecutive on-curve points along a single contour
2. The first and last points (A and D) must each have exactly one off-curve handle
3. The segments connecting A-B, B-C, and C-D must be straight lines (no off-curve points)
4. Handle both open and closed contours correctly

If the selected points meet these criteria, the system logs "Eligible" to the console. If exactly four points are selected but they don't meet the criteria, the system logs an "Ineligible" message with details about why the selection doesn't meet the required configuration.

This feature is useful for font designers who need to validate specific point configurations in their glyphs, possibly as part of a larger workflow or as a quality control mechanism.

## 2. Technical Implementation Details

### Core Logic Function in path-functions.js

The core validation logic is implemented in the `checkFourPointConfiguration` function in [`src-js/fontra-core/src/path-functions.js`](src-js/fontra-core/src/path-functions.js:1198-1326). This function:

1. Verifies exactly four points are selected
2. Ensures all points belong to the same contour
3. Checks that the points are consecutive on the contour
4. Validates that all four points are on-curve points
5. Confirms that the first and last points each have exactly one off-curve handle
6. Ensures segments between consecutive points are straight lines

### Hotkey Registration in scene-controller.js

The feature is registered as an action in [`src-js/views-editor/src/scene-controller.js`](src-js/views-editor/src/scene-controller.js:555-565):

```javascript
registerAction(
  "action.check-four-point-configuration",
  {
    topic,
    titleKey: "action.check-four-point-configuration",
    defaultShortCuts: [{ baseKey: "e", commandKey: true, altKey: true }],
  },
  () => this.doCheckFourPointConfiguration(),
  () => this.sceneSettings.selectedGlyph?.isEditing
);
```

The default hotkey is Cmd+Alt+E (or Ctrl+Alt+E on Windows).

### Handler Function Implementation

The handler function `doCheckFourPointConfiguration` in [`src-js/views-editor/src/scene-controller.js`](src-js/views-editor/src/scene-controller.js:1520-1550) implements the user-facing functionality:

1. Retrieves the current selection
2. Parses the point selection
3. Validates that exactly four points are selected
4. Gets the current glyph's path
5. Calls the core validation function
6. Logs "Eligible" to the console if the configuration matches
7. Logs an "Ineligible" message with details to the console when exactly four points are selected but don't meet the criteria

## 3. Files Modified with Specific Line References

1. **src-js/fontra-core/src/path-functions.js**
   - Added `checkFourPointConfiguration` function: lines [1198-1326](src-js/fontra-core/src/path-functions.js:1198-1326)

2. **src-js/views-editor/src/scene-controller.js**
   - Registered the action: lines [555-565](src-js/views-editor/src/scene-controller.js:555-565)
   - Implemented the handler function: lines [1520-1550](src-js/views-editor/src/scene-controller.js:1520-1550)

## 4. How the Feature Works from User Perspective

1. User opens a glyph for editing in Fontra
2. User selects exactly four consecutive on-curve points on a single contour
3. User presses Cmd+Alt+E (or Ctrl+Alt+E on Windows) to trigger the validation
4. If the selected points meet the required configuration:
   - The word "Eligible" is logged to the browser's console
5. If the selected points don't meet the configuration:
   - An "Ineligible" message with details is logged to the browser's console

## 5. Detailed Testing Instructions

To test this feature:

1. Open Fontra and load a font project
2. Open a glyph for editing that contains contours with multiple on-curve points
3. Select exactly four consecutive on-curve points on a single contour:
   - Click the first point
   - Hold Shift and click the next three points in sequence
4. Press Cmd+Alt+E (or Ctrl+Alt+E on Windows)
5. Open the browser's developer console (F12 in most browsers)
6. Verify that "Eligible" is logged to the console when:
   - All four points are consecutive on-curve points
   - The first and last points each have exactly one off-curve handle
   - The segments between consecutive points are straight lines
7. Verify that an "Ineligible" message is logged when exactly four points are selected but they don't meet the criteria

## 6. Edge Cases Handled

1. **Incorrect number of points**: The function returns false immediately if not exactly four points are selected
2. **Points on different contours**: The function returns false if the selected points don't all belong to the same contour
3. **Non-consecutive points**: The function returns false if the selected points are not consecutive on the contour
4. **Off-curve points**: The function returns false if any of the selected points are off-curve points
5. **Invalid handle configuration**: The function returns false if the first or last points don't each have exactly one off-curve handle
6. **Open vs. closed contours**: The function correctly handles both open and closed contours, including wraparound cases in closed contours
7. **Invalid glyph state**: The function gracefully handles cases where there's no active glyph or path

## 7. Future Considerations or Improvements

1. **User feedback**: The feature now provides enhanced feedback by logging "Ineligible" messages with details when four points are selected but don't meet the criteria. A more user-friendly notification system could still be implemented, such as:
   - A status bar message
   - A temporary overlay notification
   - An audible cue

2. **Configuration flexibility**: The validation criteria could be made configurable rather than hardcoded, allowing users to define their own point configuration rules.

3. **Extended validation**: The feature could be extended to validate other common point configurations that font designers frequently need to check.

4. **Visual indication**: Instead of just logging "Eligible," the feature could visually highlight the matching points or segments in the glyph view.

5. **Batch processing**: The feature could be extended to check multiple sets of four points at once, or to automatically scan a glyph for all valid four-point configurations.

6. **Integration with other tools**: This validation could be integrated with other Fontra tools, such as contour manipulation or quality assurance features.

7. **Performance optimization**: For very complex glyphs, the validation algorithm could be optimized to handle large numbers of points more efficiently.

# Progress Report: Step 1-B Point Expansion Implementation

## Summary

This document describes the implementation of the point expansion functionality for the "Expand terminals (create chord)" feature in Fontra. The implementation expands eligible terminal nodes by inserting outward on-curve nodes and connecting them with a straight chord.

## Files Modified

1. `src-js/fontra-core/src/path-functions.js`
2. `src-js/views-editor/src/scene-controller.js`

## Functions Added/Modified

### In `src-js/fontra-core/src/path-functions.js`:

1. **`expandTerminals()`**
   - Extended the function to perform actual point expansion when eligibility checks pass
   - Computes new point positions by projecting along each node's handle direction outside the glyph
   - Inserts two new on-curve points immediately adjacent after their mother nodes
   - Tags the expanded points with attributes identifying their mother nodes
   - Returns absolute indices of new points and created attributes info

2. **`testExpandTerminals()`**
   - New tester function to verify if expansion was successful
   - Checks that exactly 2 new points were created
   - Verifies that the new points are on-curve
   - Validates that the points have the correct attributes with proper mother indices

3. **`getExpandedPoints()`**
   - New helper function to retrieve all expanded points from a path
   - Useful for debugging and verification purposes

4. **`testExpandTerminalsImplementation()`**
   - Simple test function to verify the expandTerminals implementation
   - Provides console output for testing feedback

### In `src-js/views-editor/src/scene-controller.js`:

1. **Updated "expand-terminals" action**
   - Enhanced to handle the return value from expandTerminals()
   - Updates selection to the newly created points after expansion
   - Properly integrates with the editGlyph mechanism for undo/redo support
   - Returns appropriate change description for the undo system

## Point Expansion Implementation Details

The point expansion implementation works as follows:

1. **Eligibility Validation**
   - Performs all eligibility checks from Step 1-A
   - If validation passes, proceeds with point expansion

2. **Handle Direction Determination**
   - Uses `getPrimaryHandleDirection()` to determine the handle direction for each selected point
   - Gets the actual handle points based on the determined directions

3. **Expansion Point Calculation**
   - Uses `computeExpansionPoint()` to calculate new positions for expanded points
   - Projects along each node's handle direction outside the glyph
   - Uses a fallback distance when the handle vector is too small

4. **Point Insertion**
   - Inserts the first new on-curve point directly after its mother node
   - Adjusts the insertion index for the second point if needed (when points are on the same contour)
   - Ensures the mother â†’ n?a segment is a straight line segment

5. **Point Tagging**
   - Uses `tagPointAttr()` to label expanded points with attributes
   - Tags include the mother point index for identification
   - Attributes use the key 'fontra.chord.expanded'

6. **Selection Update**
   - Updates the editor selection to the two new n1a, n2a points
   - Provides visual feedback to the user about the created points

## Tester Functions

Two new tester functions were added to verify correct execution:

1. **`testExpandTerminals()`**
   - Takes a path, original point indices, and the result from expandTerminals()
   - Verifies the result contains exactly 2 new points
   - Checks that new points are on-curve
   - Validates that points have correct attributes with proper mother indices
   - Outputs test results to the console

2. **`getExpandedPoints()`**
   - Retrieves all expanded points from a path
   - Useful for debugging and verification
   - Returns point indices, point data, and mother indices

## Hotkey Registration

The "Expand terminals (create chord)" action is registered with the hotkey **Ctrl+Alt+E** in the scene controller.

## Integration with Existing Mechanisms

The implementation integrates with the existing editGlyph mechanism for undo/redo support. The expand-terminals action:
- Uses the editGlyph function to perform the operation
- Works with multiple layers if needed
- Integrates with the change recording system for proper undo/redo functionality
- Updates selection to the newly created points
