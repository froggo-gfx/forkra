## Added Missing Imports to Editor.js

Added the missing imports for `POINT_TYPE_OFF_CURVE_QUAD` and `POINT_TYPE_OFF_CURVE_CUBIC` to the `src-js/views-editor/src/editor.js` file.

Specifically, updated the import statement from:
```javascript
import { VarPackedPath, joinPaths } from "@fontra/core/var-path.js";
```

To:
```javascript
import {
  POINT_TYPE_OFF_CURVE_CUBIC,
  POINT_TYPE_OFF_CURVE_QUAD,
  VarPackedPath,
  joinPaths,
} from "@fontra/core/var-path.js";
```


## Updated String Literal Comparisons in Scene-Controller.js

Updated the string literal comparisons in the `getSelectedSingleOffCurvePoints` function in `src-js/views-editor/src/scene-controller.js` to use proper constants.

Specifically, changed the comparison from:
```javascript
if (point && point.type && (point.type === "quad" || point.type === "cubic")) {
```

To:
```javascript
if (point && point.type && (point.type === POINT_TYPE_OFF_CURVE_QUAD || point.type === POINT_TYPE_OFF_CURVE_CUBIC)) {
```

This required adding the following import statement to the file:
```javascript
import {
  VarPackedPath,
  POINT_TYPE_OFF_CURVE_CUBIC,
  POINT_TYPE_OFF_CURVE_QUAD,
  packContour,
} from "@fontra/core/var-path.js";
```

## Investigation: Backspace Key Deleting Two Off-Curve Points

### Issue Analysis
The backspace key is deleting two off-curve points instead of just the selected one. After analyzing the code, I've identified the root cause of this issue.

### Root Cause
The problem is in the `deleteSingleOffCurvePoint` function in `src-js/fontra-core/src/path-functions.js`. When deleting an off-curve point that is part of a curve segment, the function only removes the selected point but doesn't properly handle the curve segment that would be left with only one point.

In a quadratic curve segment, there are typically three points: start point (on-curve), control point (off-curve), and end point (on-curve). When the control point is deleted, the curve segment should be converted to a straight line segment between the two on-curve points.

However, the current implementation simply removes the off-curve point without adjusting the surrounding points, which can cause unexpected behavior.

### Relevant Code Sections

1. In `src-js/views-editor/src/editor.js`, the backspace key is handled by the "action.delete-single-off-curve" action:
   ```javascript
   registerAction(
     "action.delete-single-off-curve",
     {
       topic: "0030-action-topics.menu.edit",
       titleKey: "action.delete-single-off-curve",
       defaultShortCuts: [{ baseKey: "Backspace", commandKey: true }],
     },
     () => this.doDeleteSingleOffCurvePoint(),
     () => this.canDeleteSingleOffCurvePoint()
   );
   ```

2. The `doDeleteSingleOffCurvePoint` method calls the `deleteSingleOffCurvePoint` function from `@fontra/core/path-functions.js`.

3. In `src-js/fontra-core/src/path-functions.js`, the `deleteSingleOffCurvePoint` function only removes the point:
   ```javascript
   export function deleteSingleOffCurvePoint(path, pointIndex) {
     // Validate that the point exists
     if (pointIndex < 0 || pointIndex >= path.numPoints) {
       return false;
     }

     // Get the point and check if it's an off-curve point
     const point = path.getPoint(pointIndex);
     if (!point.type || (point.type !== POINT_TYPE_OFF_CURVE_QUAD && point.type !== POINT_TYPE_OFF_CURVE_CUBIC)) {
       return false;
     }

     // Get the contour index and contour point index
     const [contourIndex, contourPointIndex] = path.getContourAndPointIndex(pointIndex);

     // Delete the point directly from the contour
     path.deletePoint(contourIndex, contourPointIndex);

     return true;
   }
   ```

### Solution Approach
The function needs to be enhanced to properly handle the curve segment after deleting the off-curve point. It should:
1. Check if the deleted point was part of a curve segment
2. If so, convert the curve segment to a straight line by adjusting the adjacent points
3. Ensure that the resulting path is valid

This will prevent the deletion of one off-curve point from affecting adjacent segments or causing the deletion of additional points.
This change was made to resolve missing import errors in the editor.js file.
