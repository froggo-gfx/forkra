# Progress Report: Step 1-B Point Expansion Implementation

## Summary

This document describes the implementation of the point expansion functionality for the "Expand terminals (create chord)" feature in Fontra. The implementation expands eligible terminal nodes by inserting outward on-curve nodes and connecting them with a straight chord.

## Files Modified

1. `src-js/fontra-core/src/path-functions.js`
2. `src-js/views-editor/src/scene-controller.js`

## Functions Added/Modified

### In `src-js/fontra-core/src/path-functions.js`:

1. **`expandTerminals()`**
   - Extended the function to perform actual point expansion when eligibility checks pass
   - Computes new point positions by projecting along each node's handle direction outside the glyph
   - Inserts two new on-curve points immediately adjacent after their mother nodes
   - Tags the expanded points with attributes identifying their mother nodes
   - Returns absolute indices of new points and created attributes info

2. **`testExpandTerminals()`**
   - New tester function to verify if expansion was successful
   - Checks that exactly 2 new points were created
   - Verifies that the new points are on-curve
   - Validates that the points have the correct attributes with proper mother indices

3. **`getExpandedPoints()`**
   - New helper function to retrieve all expanded points from a path
   - Useful for debugging and verification purposes

4. **`testExpandTerminalsImplementation()`**
   - Simple test function to verify the expandTerminals implementation
   - Provides console output for testing feedback

### In `src-js/views-editor/src/scene-controller.js`:

1. **Updated "expand-terminals" action**
   - Enhanced to handle the return value from expandTerminals()
   - Updates selection to the newly created points after expansion
   - Properly integrates with the editGlyph mechanism for undo/redo support
   - Returns appropriate change description for the undo system

## Point Expansion Implementation Details

The point expansion implementation works as follows:

1. **Eligibility Validation**
   - Performs all eligibility checks from Step 1-A
   - If validation passes, proceeds with point expansion

2. **Handle Direction Determination**
   - Uses `getPrimaryHandleDirection()` to determine the handle direction for each selected point
   - Gets the actual handle points based on the determined directions

3. **Expansion Point Calculation**
   - Uses `computeExpansionPoint()` to calculate new positions for expanded points
   - Projects along each node's handle direction outside the glyph
   - Uses a fallback distance when the handle vector is too small

4. **Point Insertion**
   - Inserts the first new on-curve point directly after its mother node
   - Adjusts the insertion index for the second point if needed (when points are on the same contour)
   - Ensures the mother â†’ n?a segment is a straight line segment

5. **Point Tagging**
   - Uses `tagPointAttr()` to label expanded points with attributes
   - Tags include the mother point index for identification
   - Attributes use the key 'fontra.chord.expanded'

6. **Selection Update**
   - Updates the editor selection to the two new n1a, n2a points
   - Provides visual feedback to the user about the created points

## Tester Functions

Two new tester functions were added to verify correct execution:

1. **`testExpandTerminals()`**
   - Takes a path, original point indices, and the result from expandTerminals()
   - Verifies the result contains exactly 2 new points
   - Checks that new points are on-curve
   - Validates that points have correct attributes with proper mother indices
   - Outputs test results to the console

2. **`getExpandedPoints()`**
   - Retrieves all expanded points from a path
   - Useful for debugging and verification
   - Returns point indices, point data, and mother indices

## Hotkey Registration

The "Expand terminals (create chord)" action is registered with the hotkey **Ctrl+Alt+E** in the scene controller.

## Integration with Existing Mechanisms

The implementation integrates with the existing editGlyph mechanism for undo/redo support. The expand-terminals action:
- Uses the editGlyph function to perform the operation
- Works with multiple layers if needed
- Integrates with the change recording system for proper undo/redo functionality
- Updates selection to the newly created points
