// This file has been repurposed as part of the Tunni Tool to Visual Layer Refactoring Plan.
// The original TunniTool and TunniEditingTool classes have been removed since their 
// functionality has been integrated into the pointer tool and moved to tunni-calculations.js
// 
// This file is maintained for backward compatibility. All Tunni-related functionality
// is now handled by the PointerTool in edit-tools-pointer.js and calculations in 
// tunni-calculations.js.
